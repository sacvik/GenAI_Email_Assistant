Hi Manoj,

 

We have noticed some deviations in the data extraction for the latest file of the Port Hedland source. We receive data monthly for this source. The latest data for the month of March is available on the website and we expect that information to be extracted as a single file. 



 

But we see 8 new files getting placed on the output bucket. All these files are referring to older date information which were unintended to be extracted. A similar issue had occurred last month for this source. 



Request your team to kindly look into this issue at the earliest and hope that this deviation would not occur again.

Hi Issac, 

 

MINT will still be available but Cflow which is included as part of MINT is being retired which is why we are transitioning you to CAS Liquid Bulk with CAS Dry Bulk complimentary. 

Simply put, Cflow which you used for liquid bulk analysis you will now get through CAS Liquid Bulk, for your dry bulk analysis you would access this through CAS Dry Bulk, the CAS combo has vessel tracking so you won’t lose that critical component to your daily workflow. If anything, it will be enhanced as you will now be able to tell the specific cargoes that the vessels you track are carrying.

 

I hope that makes sense.

2025-07-01,RE: Norden / S&P Global - FRF Analyst Call ,"Dear Norden team

 

Thankyou for your queries on the agribulk trade forecast. Please see our response in green below. Please feel free to reach out in case there are further clarifications. 

 

1.US soybeans – If you assume no trade-deal between US and China in your forecast, can you please break up Q4 importers and perhaps why? (we are having a little hard time seeing how any other importers can take over from Chinas normal offtake)

 

Our projections for US’ exports in 2H25 had been revised downward in early June amid the policy uncertainty around the trade tariffs.

Shipments have been revised down marginally, compared to our previous report, for corn as well as soybean trade in 3Q25, as the pause in reciprocal tariffs will end but the trade negotiations have not substantially progressed thus far. The shipments to Mainland China continue to be projected downwards in 4Q24, creating much of the vacuum for US’ overall supplies, as Mainland China’s overall soybean demand is projected to moderate despite the possibility that future negotiations between the two economies will bear some fruit. Despite the trade tensions, we do not expect that there will be no trade at all between the two economies since Mainland China’s soybean supplies in the fourth quarter are typically supplied by the US and storing Brazilian soybeans for long hasn’t been reported as quite feasible given its moisture content.  Please refer to our report published last month for additional details: Connect <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/6016644?connectPath=CAS.Documents&searchSessionId=e5593d0a-fe48-4237-9f1b-283b21301192> 

 

Global soybean S/D-Q4 2025



2. Can you break up US grain exports by USG and NOPAC?

 

Please refer to our monthly report for details on regional exports: Connect <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/6016644?connectPath=CAS.Documents&searchSessionId=e5593d0a-fe48-4237-9f1b-283b21301192> 

 

3. Can you elaborate on Brazil grains? Will we see an overlapping soybean and corn export window (if yes, by how much), and any comments on potential bottlenecks/congestion that it might cause?

 

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, Brazil’s winter corn harvest remains slow even though there has been good progress in central Brazil. The below chart indicates that the progress in corn harvest is close to the 5-yr average but is slower than last year as of last week.

 

Moreover, the delay in soybean harvest inevitably led to slight delays in corn sowing in many regions. With a shortened planting window in many regions, it is possible that the harvest timing might also be uneven and different from last year (such as in Mato Grosso).Brazil’s center-south region has planted only 20% of the expected second corn area, behind last year’s 38% planted during the same period.

 

There is an overlap season of corn and soybean exports in the third quarter from Brazil. We can see according to CAS data that Brazil’s corn shipments, which typically start progressing in June, were only 0.6 million mt this time, 0.5 million tonnes less y/y. This indicates that there might be an impact of delayed soybean harvesting on corn harvests as well.

Moreover, we saw heightened congestion in 3Q23 when Brazil’s corn harvests were record high and we can see from our monthly data that shipments for corn+ soybean in July, Aug and Sept were either close to or higher than 15 million tonnes that year.

 

 

 

Monthly corn+ soybean shipments



 

We did expect similar monthly volumes for corn+ soybean in 3Q25 as well according to our report on Brazil agribulk last month: Connect <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/6011620?connectPath=CAS.Documents&searchSessionId=293f5360-99fa-4e8b-a98e-21db2ef6b10c> , but some delays in harvests might dampen corn volumes in this quarter, which we will keep monitoring. However, much higher tonnage availability now for geared vessels relative to last few years has the potential to dampen spikes in congestion. We have also not observed any major congestion issue in the region in a while. 

 

4. Can you quantify on the Frontloading and how that impacts future tonnes, with focus on Q3 and Q4?  

 

We did see the impact of frontloading of total US’ shipments in April 2025 but the overall trade with Mainland China remained subdued so far due to the latter’s declining demand attributed to its ample domestic supplies. With EU, the heightened shipments could be seen in 2Q25 as well, with higher volumes for soybeans, corn and soybean meal. But this uptrend will likely be adversely impacted when some sort of tariffs kick in with Europe, inviting counter-tariffs on soybeans. We currently expect volumes to be marginally lower y/y to Europe in 2H25. Soybean shipments to Mainland China, as mentioned above, are projected to decline in 4Q25. 

 

The CAS team also publishes the outlook report every month where we share our forecasts Connect <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/6023513?connectPath=CAS.Documents&searchSessionId=88587164-c3f0-4df8-aa90-56d94068ae25> . The next outlook report will be published next week wherein we will share a detailed analysis of our expectations for 2H25. 

If there are any further clarifications, we can also setup a call to address them.

Subject: RE: Norden / S&P Global - FRF Analyst Call 

 

Dear Norden Team,

Thank you for your query on the reasons behind the quarter-on-quarter change to our West Africa iron ore trade forecast. The changes are primarily attributed to the following factors:

 

1.	We have revised Guinea's annual shipment projections downward from 2026 onwards, based on insights gathered during the Singapore International Ferrous Week conference last May. We anticipate a more gradual ramp-up of the Simandou project due to expected challenges in rail infrastructure development, along with the likelihood that not all mined ore will be shipped.
2.	The Gabon forecast has been nullified from this year onward concerning the Belinga Iron Ore Project, based on insights from our analyst's visit to FMG in Australia.
3.	Conversely, we have observed strong shipments from Liberia, supported by the iron ore expansion project undertaken by ArcelorMittal.

 

Please find attached link to the Africa Iron Ore report published in April: S&P Global Commodities at Sea Insight (Iron Ore) - Africa (28 April 2025) <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/5991834?connectPath=CAS.Documents> 

Kindly let us know if you require further clarification.

Thank you.

Hi Kevin,

As requested, we have added “Russia – Black Sea” to Black Sea along with already present “Black Sea”.

PFA updated Trade_Metrics_Dirty file.

Thanks,

Many thanks Subho! 

 

Appreciated the support.

 

In the next refresh, could you kindly update the rule for the BlackSea tabs in Trade_Metrics_dirty? As I can see we have many 0s results. The reason could be that in Trade_Metrics, we have to select the region “Russia - Black Sea” too.

 

Please include both “Black Sea” and “Russia-Black Sea” in next week’s update for BlackSea results in Trade Metrics_dirty. 

 

Many thanks.

 

Best Rgds,

Kevin

Hi Subho,

 

Many thanks for sharing!

 

While reviewing the data I found that in the trade metrics files, the min_date_ping for the data extracted are set as Sundays (i.e., 2023-12-31). As previously advised, we would appreciate if you could keep the consistence and extract the data as Saturdays (i.e., 2023-12-30), as per last week’s practice.

 

Could you kindly re-share the adjusted data? Look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

 

Best Rgds,

Kevin

Hi Kevin,

 

We are facing issues accessing our EC2 instances from the morning today. Since, we run all our codes in EC2, we will be able to share the files for today only after the issue is resolved. 

 

As for Ballast Analytics, we are still working on it and would try to complete it soon. We will let you know once it is completed.

 

Thanks,

Subho

Hi Fotios, 

I have incorporated the port name standardized. But I see there are new variations came up.
This can become a cause of concern as we will need to update these port with region every week before we run ballast analytics data extraction.

I am attaching this week’s unmatched port region.

let me know your thought if we want to update these every week?

Hi Kevin, 

 

I am working on the changes, I’ll send the files for Congestion, Trade Matric and Data Query today. 

I will also try to complete speed analytics tab today. 

I am waiting for the port region mapping for the ports which I shared couple of weeks back. I’ll use that to work on ballast analytics.

 

Thanks,

Dear Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Further to our exchanges, what is the progress regarding the data extraction? It would be a great help if you could prioritize this request and provide the updated data to us today.

 

Many thanks.

Hi Sachin, 

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

We found out that the data in some sheets (especially the trade metrics) with the most recent week always show a significant drop. If we double check the dashboard, the data will improve and rise to a more logical level from Tuesday onwards that could better reflect the actual levels. 

 

We believe it can be improved by changing the definition of weeks. In the next update, could you kindly adjust the “start of the week” to Saturday? We understand we are using Sundays now. 

 

Please let us know if this can be applied in our next update. Happy to schedule a call to discuss this too along with our advices last week if needed.

Hi Kevin, 

It looks like trade matrics file got corrupted due to which we saw different sheet names.
I will do changes as you have mentioned in the mail below and get back to you next week.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

For the shared trade metrics and congestion file, please kindly find below feedback:

 

1.	Names of some sheets in the trade metrics file (both clean and dirty) are not showed correctly. Could you kindly check the reason of this? It seems the sheets were recovered, will this cause potential data loss? The sheets’ names are as follows:
	Trade Metrics Clean

Aframax/LR2 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet1

Panamax/LR1 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet2

Aframax/LR2 Med volume showed as Recovered_sheet3

Panamax/LR1 Med showed as Recovered_sheet4

 

Trade Metrics Dirty

Aframax//LR2 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet1

Aframax/LR2 Nigeria/Angola volume showed as Recovered_sheet2

Aframax/LR2 Med volume showed as Recovered_sheet3

 

Also, for Trade Metrics Clean file, we lack the sheet of MR Middle East Gulf volume. The MR Middle East Gulf Shipment sheet showed that there should be a steady volume exporting from the region, please kindly check this before our next update.

2.	As exchanged earlier, we should have 0s returning in some certain sheets. We need to show weeks with a result of 0 here as well, rather than deleting them.  For example:



For sheets like this, we should have other weeks return 0. In this refresh, each table in the trade metrics files should return 396 results (396 weeks), and we need to show 0 here as well.

3.	For Trade Metrics_Dirty, please add Russia – Black Sea for the BlackSea results as well. Far East region in Trade Metrics_Clean is corrected is updated too. Please find the highlighted area in the attached file.

 

Many thanks for your support on this.

Hi Sachin,

 

After going through the file we found that the Aframax and LR2 /Panamax and LR1s are not combined.

 

Could you kindly combine them from your side? As discussed:

 

Please kindly combine Aframax/LR2 for dirty, labeled as such; LR1/Panamax and LR2/Aframax for clean, labeled as such.

 

Many thanks in advance.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Please find attached our enquiry files shared. As discussed, we would like you to extract all vessel sectors for dirty/clean separately; that is, VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax/LR2 for dirty tankers; VLCC, Suezmax, LR2/Aframax, LR1/Panamax, MR for clean tankers (monitoring bigger tonnages such as VLCC and Suezmax would allow us to capture the cleanup trend therefore we put them on the list.). We expect to have lots of 0s returned from result, we believe it would ensure a minimal update in the future.

 

Also, as per today’s call, I have updated Ballast Analytics’ sheet hoping that you could manage to find a way to use start region/end region instead of start country/end country.

 

We can connect on details if needed tomorrow. Appreciate your support on this update, however if the changes of codes cannot be fulfilled before next Monday (as we see the weekly update as the priority), please kindly refresh our sheets as per we previous sent.

 

Many thanks.

Hi Sachin,

 

Please let us know when the next update could be in place, as discussed, we hope this could be a weekly regular one.

 

Meanwhile, we also noticed that in the file Trade_Metrics_Clean, we couldn’t find LR2’s shipments from India. I have highlighted it in yellow for next update, please kindly check the attachment.

 

Also, as discussed previously on the call, we are having 0s for some week’s results in some tabs, especially when extracting clean Panamax and dirty LR2s. These rows were not showing, causing us some verifying trouble. Considering this, could you converge these data together? In short, could you include clean-trading Panamaxes and clean LR1s together, labeled as clean LR1s? In the same manner, dirty-trading LR2s and dirty Aframaxes together, labeled as LR2s?

 

Look forward to having your feedback. We can have a call to discuss this when you are available.

Hi Kevin, 

 

I will connect with Penang team related to regular data extraction. I will send you update by tomorrow.

 

Furthermore, I have made the correction on Ballast Analytics file.

For trade matrics I will try to investigate why data is not populated for black sea.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

As discussed earlier, please keep us posted if Penang team could provide us with the regular refreshments by every Monday, starting from next Monday.

 

Also as mentioned, I have corrected the metrics for Ballast Analytics file. Please include Russia as part of the Black Sea, I have highlighted the change in yellow for you reference too.

 

Please also include clean LR1/Panamax for UKC laden/ballast as well. They are highlighted as well.

 

For Trade_Metrics_Dirty file, Black Sea returns nothing however we have selected all countries under the region Black Sea:



Is this because you have to choose countries manually and Russia was not included? If that’s the case please include Russia there too, many thanks.

 

Let’s discuss tomorrow in detail on how to get the regular update if you are available, thank you once again on your help.

Hi Kevin, 

 

I have gone through the requirement documents provided by you in previous mail.

We will start working on this from next week. 

As the requirements are updated and some newly added. It may take more time to generate the data than previous iteration.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Following our previous exchanges please find our data extraction enquiry in CAS LB. We will need your help in pulling data from the Data Query this time. 

 

The data should be refreshed on a weekly basis, could you confirm if this is possible once the preparation is done ? We can arrange a call at your convenience to discuss the details.

 

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Mismatch.

By Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst | Swissquote Bank

So, here we are on July 1st. US equities are back at all-time highs. Most headlines credit the rebound to optimism around trade negotiations—hopes that deals will be struck before the July 9 deadline—and expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could cut rates sooner rather than later. But this rally is mostly driven and shouldered by AI optimism – the rest remains uncertain.

The trade headlines, while encouraging, aren’t especially promising. The negotiations with Japan are bumpy. The Japanese, understandably, are reluctant to buy American rice, and as a result, they may soon receive a ‘reveal letter’ detailing the tariff rate they’ll be subjected to. As for the EU, talks are just as uncertain. European could accept 10% universal tariff but demand exceptions for key sectors like drugs, alcohol, chips, planes, cars, steel an aluminum that they might not get.

On the monetary policy front, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been crystal clear: it’s not smart to rush to the exit when the implications of new tariffs on inflation and growth are still unknown. That warning was reinforced by last week’s core PCE data, which came in hotter than expected, suggesting that inflation may be making a U-turn—moving away from the 2% target. That means even if economic data on growth or jobs begins to weaken, the Fed is likely to prioritize tackling inflation first. Yet, this doesn’t seem fully priced into markets.

There’s a clear mismatch between how markets are positioned and the risks that remain on the table. Trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, the ballooning US debt burden, the possibility that the Fed might not be able to cut rates, signs of economic slowdown, and even a potential re-acceleration in inflation—none of these risks have disappeared. They’ve simply been pushed aside, priced in and out over recent months, but they persist.

Retail investors continue to drive the rally. The latest COT data shows that institutional demand has improved slightly, but still feels lukewarm. That’s understandable, given the trend in earnings expectations. According to FactSet, second-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth estimates have been revised down from 9.4% at the end of March to just 5%. That downgrade is barely reflected in market pricing, making the upcoming earnings season a potential minefield.

From here, the path forward is essentially a coin toss. In one scenario, trade deals are struck, everyone leaves the negotiating table happy, the Middle East finds peace, the US addresses its soaring debt, inflation slows, and economic growth accelerates. But if that doesn’t happen—and some of the risks materialize—markets could face a sharp reality check. Earnings could disappoint, macro data could weaken, trade deals could fall short or prove unsustainable, and US debt worries could resurface—especially given that the latest tax bill is expected to add $3 trillion to the federal deficit. That would require a ramp-up in debt issuance, which could push yields higher just as corporate profits come under pressure.

Investors vs CFOs

Investor sentiment may appear upbeat, but those making real-world business decisions are more cautious. A recent Teneo survey shows nearly 80% of investors expect the global economy to improve over the next six months. Yet 43% of global CFOs disagree. In fact, the majority of US CFOs expect interest rates to rise—not fall—over that same period. We can choose to ignore those views, but CFOs are decision-makers, and they’ve already started to act, slowing hiring and reassessing supply chains.

That said, one area continues to shine: AI. Strong capital expenditure is flowing into AI projects, with the aim of replacing labour, cutting costs, and boosting productivity. That could help tame inflation over the long run and support growth. Oracle announced a major cloud deal expected to bring in up to $30 billion annually from fiscal 2028. Its stock jumped 4% on the news. Meta also hit an all-time high on reports it plans to spend ‘hundreds of billions’ on projects and research. Nvidia continues to hover near record highs.

But beyond the AI sector, the broader macro picture remains fragile. All eyes are now on US labour market data this week. Job openings are due today, followed by the ADP employment report tomorrow and nonfarm payrolls, wage figures, and the unemployment rate on Thursday. Moderately soft figures may support expectations of Fed rate cuts and push equities even higher. But if the data is too weak, it could raise concerns about the economic impact of recent policy shifts, prompting some investors to lock in profits and head to the sidelines ahead of the slower summer months.

Meanwhile, the US dollar remains under pressure. The EURUSD touched the 1.18 level this morning after an unexpected dip in German inflation revived dovish European Central Bank (ECB) expectations. Today’s euro area aggregate inflation number is likely to land near the ECB’s 2% target, reinforcing the view that the central bank will remain accommodative. The euro outlook remains positive, but technically speaking, the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions. Deep bearish dollar positioning also suggests that some profit-taking could lead to a short-term correction before the euro resumes its march toward the 1.20 mark.

Dear All/Samrath

 

Thurlestone Research News Highlights

Tuesday 1st Jul 2025

 

•  China will extend its anti-dumping duties on some stainless steel products from the European Union, United Kingdom, South Korea and Indonesia for another five years from Tuesday in a bid to protect domestic manufacturers ↓

 

•  Saudi Arabia is set to impose final anti-dumping duties on imports of steel and stainless steel pipes originating from China and Taiwan, effective June 30, for a period of five years, in a bid to enhance the competitiveness of national products ↓

 

•  Hyundai Steel announced on the 30th that it will not operate its Incheon rebar plant for 42 days from the 21st to the 31st of next month for summer factory maintenance ↓

 

----------------------------------------------------



 

Freight
•  Capesize 5TC moved -4.9% (-$898) to $17,510. MTD at $24,076. YTD at $15,794. Better flows in the Pacific to start the week, BHP and Rio Tinto were both in for mid-July dates on top of the Korean tenders, solid operator business and continued coal enquiry ex East Coast Australia. C5 offers started in the mid $7’s, before slowly recalibrating to low $7’s and BHP engaged with a $6.70 bid, finally linked to an initial $6.90 deal. Rio Tinto kept their powder dry until late afternoon, most of their offers sat in the low $7’s, before throwing out a $6.60 bid but nothing linked in the end. Bids pushed up to $7.0 into the evening (on back of better C5/tender deals) and should cargo flows continue, it puts us on better footing in the Pacific. Coal continues to price on Cape bottoms, adding that ever important 3rd layer of support needed for a good cleanout. Across the pond, the tone was less optimistic, despite decent cargo enquiry on C3. Trafigura claimed to be seeing sub $20 for their Sudeste stem 22nd onwarrds and a couple of forward deals struck in the low-mid $19’s (Aug laycans) reaffirming the direction. West Africa was notably quieter, only playing an optionality role yesterday while activity from the North Atlantic was limited. Feels as though the Atlantic is likely to bear the brunt of the Pacific’s inactivity these past weeks, as many Owners had no option but to ballast in hope of better returns.

 

•  Panamax 5TC moved +0.7% (+$92) to $13,502. MTD at $12,009. YTD at $10,701. The North Atlantic saw a decent start to the week with early engagement seen on both the transatlantic and fronthaul. The fundamentals also looked supportive as tonnage supply began to look tighter after a fairly eventful last week. Turning to the ECSA, demand appeared to be supportive as well though little exchange was seen.

 

The North Pacific market saw a quieter start to the week with limited fresh enquiry surfacing though there wasn’t significant movement on the tonnage count either. There were a few 15-20 July laycans to be covered ex East Coast Australia but liquidity remained limited, much like ex North Pacific. End July was a bit more active as it afforded Operators some time to play around with their fleet or find market tonnage. Offers on voyage stems for East Coast Australia/China coal were around P3A levels while repositional stems in South East Asia offered equivalent to around $11,000 on less well-described Post-panamaxes ex China. Meanwhile, few offer were refreshed for TC trips at the same rates from Friday’s close – in the $13,000 BKI CJK. Despite aenemic cargo flows yesterday, the market looks as though it is still holding on. The Indonesian basin appeared to be the healthiest sector of the Pacific basin, hosting the majority of fresh cargoes. With a supported ECSA market at the end of last week and a stable tonnage list in the South, bids and offers are expected to move up in tandem for the shorter rounds.

 

Commodities

 

Oil

•  Oil prices edged down on Monday as investors weighed easing Middle East risks and a possible OPEC+ output increase in August

 

•  U.S. crude oil production hit a record 13.47 million barrels-per-day in April, up from 13.45 million bpd in March, according to data released by the Energy Information Administration as part of its Petroleum Supply Monthly series. The EIA had previously estimated U.S. oil output at 13.49 million bpd in March. Crude oil production in top-producing state Texas rose 1.8% to 5.77 million bpd, the highest since November, the EIA data showed. In second-largest producer New Mexico, output was down 3.4% month-over-month to 2.19 million bpd, the EIA said

 

•  Analysts have marginally lifted their oil price forecasts after the flare-up of tensions in the Middle East, but rising OPEC+ supply and a tempered demand outlook continue to weigh on crude, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. A survey of 40 economists and analysts in June forecast Brent crude will average $67.86 per barrel in 2025, up from May's $66.98 forecast, while U.S. crude is seen at $64.51, above last month's $63.35 estimate. Prices have averaged roughly $70.80 and $67.50 so far this year respectively, as per LSEG data

 

•  The IEA’s medium-term outlook sees global oil supply increase set to far outpace demand growth in coming years. With intensifying geopolitical strains and heightened uncertainty about global economic prospects, oil markets are undergoing structural changes as the key drivers of supply and demand growth of the past 15 years start to fade, according to the latest edition of the IEA’s medium-term outlook. According to the report, China – which has driven the growth in global oil demand for well over a decade – is set to see its consumption peak in 2027, following a surge in electric vehicle sales and the continued deployment of high-speed rail and trucks running on natural gas

 

•  Morgan Stanley forecasts Brent crude will drop to around $60 per barrel by early 2026, citing easing geopolitical tensions — particularly between Israel and Iran — and a well-supplied market. The bank projects strong non-OPEC supply growth of about 1 million barrels per day in both 2025 and 2026, which it says will be enough to keep pace with global demand increases. Morgan Stanley also reiterated its view of a 1.3 million barrels per day oversupply in 2026

 

Iron Ore

•  Iron ore prices in China are holding firm, even with the country's sluggish property sector and declining manufacturing activity

 

•  International credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings has released its updated forecast for coking coal and iron ore prices, keeping projections steady for 2025 and 2026. The report highlights global economic pressures, especially stemming from China's faltering steel demand, as key drivers behind subdued price expectations. Fitch has kept its iron ore price assumptions unchanged, forecasting $90/mt for 2025 and $85/mt for 2026. This outlook is shaped primarily by weakened steel demand in China, driven by a slumping construction sector in the country and lingering impacts from the trade tensions started by the US

 

Steel

•  In June this year, the purchasing managers index (PMI) for the Chinese steel sector was at 45.9 percent, 0.5 percentage points lower than that recorded in May this year, as announced by the China Steel Logistics Committee (CSLC), which is part of the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP). Moreover, in June, the new order index stood at 45.6 percent, 0.8 percentage points lower than in May. In June, the production index for the Chinese steel sector stood at 43.5 percent, 0.7 percentage points higher than in May

 

•  Brazil's government will launch an investigation into suspected export ""dumping"" of some hot-rolled steel products from China, India and Indonesia, its official gazette said on Monday. Preliminary studies have found the sufficient evidence of dumping as well as resulting damage to its domestic steel industry, the document said. Steelmakers in Latin America's largest economy have long complained of an unfair playing field, saying that China floods the market with cheap material and calling on the government to do more to control those imports

 

•  China will extend its anti-dumping duties on some stainless steel products from certain countries and regions for another five years from Tuesday in a bid to protect domestic manufacturers. Imports of stainless steel billet and hot rolled stainless steel plate originating from European Union, United Kingdom, South Korea and Indonesia will remain subject to the anti-dumping duties ranging from 20.2% to 103.1%, China's commerce ministry said in a statement. ""The harm to the domestic industry will likely to continue if the anti-dumping measures are terminated,"" the statement said

 

•  Saudi Arabia is set to impose final anti-dumping duties on imports of steel and stainless steel pipes originating from China and Taiwan, effective June 30, for a period of five years. The duties, issued by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Kingdom’s General Authority of Foreign Trade Majid Al-Qassabi, specifically target pipes with longitudinally welded circular sections, according to a statement. This reflects Saudi Arabia’s goal to enhance the competitiveness of national products, attract investment, and foster new industries, ultimately contributing to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals 

 

•  Hyundai Steel announced on the 30th that it will not operate its Incheon rebar plant for 42 days from the 21st to the 31st of next month for summer factory maintenance. Typically, major maintenance schedules take about two weeks, but this time the production stoppage period has been extended due to worsening rebar market conditions. The maintenance work, which involves replacing consumables, is conducted 2 to 3 times a year. Hyundai Steel has been adjusting its rebar production since late last year and completely suspended production for a month in April for the first time since its establishment

 

Coal

•  Coal used to make steel got a break in the latest version of President Donald Trump's tax bill, a subsidy that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars over 10 years for a fuel that is mostly exported to countries including China. In April, Trump signed executive orders that directed Chris Wright, the energy secretary and former fracking CEO, to determine whether metallurgical, or met, coal is a ""critical mineral"" which he did in May. In the latest version of Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill that the Senate released over the weekend, met coal can claim an advanced manufacturing production tax credit, available for critical minerals, that would pay 2.5% of costs for the fuel

 

•  Above-average inventory levels will likely keep steel prices in Brazil under pressure in the coming months, steel distributors' association Inda said. Steel inventories reached 1.07mn metric tonnes (t) in May, up by 17pc from a year earlier, Inda said last week. The volume represents 3.3 months of available inventory, above the historical average of 2.9 months, which could fuel buyers' leverage to negotiate discounts in their favor. Hot-rolled products account for 685,000t of the stock, a 22pc increase from a year prior. Argus-assessed hot-rolled coil (HRC) cfr Brazil prices dropped to $507-525/t on 25 June, down from $520-540/t in early June. HRC import prices have fallen by nearly 5pc year-to-date

 

Gas

•  Russia's government has been considering some tax relief for energy giant Gazprom, offset by potentially higher taxes on other gas producers, a government source said on Monday. Novatek and Rosneft are also large gas producers in Russia. Moscow has to balance the need to boost military spending amid the conflict in Ukraine with tackling a rising budget deficit and providing sufficient support to Gazprom, which saw its lucrative sales to Europe collapse

 

•  Russia’s sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project raised production to record levels during the last days of June as the facility appears to have resumed loading cargoes. Natural gas output at the Novatek PJSC-led facility averaged 14 million cubic meters a day on June 28 and June 29, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. That’s the highest daily level for the plant, historic data shows. Higher natural gas output doesn’t automatically indicate a hike in LNG production, but historically the plant produced more gas when it was able to load cargoes. In December 2023, when it was launched, Arctic LNG 2 pumped an average of 13.7 million cubic meters of gas a day

 

•  U.S. natural gas futures give back Friday’s gains as strong weather-driven demand is seen cooling into the July 4th holiday weekend. “The market remains volatile but range-bound, with front-month contracts continuing to trade at a steep discount to winter,” Andy Huenefeld of Pinebrook Energy Advisors says in a note. “Any sustained return of heat—particularly in Texas where conditions have so far been mild—could quickly shift sentiment and push prices back toward the upper end of the range.” Nymex natural gas falls 7.6% to $3.456/mmBtu for a second-quarter loss of 16%

 

Grains

•  A heat wave in western Europe has lowered water levels on Germany's Rhine River, hampering shipping and raising freight costs for cargo owners due to additional surcharges as their vessels were unable to sail fully loaded, commodity traders said on Monday. Low water has limited shipping on all of the river south of Duisburg and Cologne, including the chokepoint of Kaub, traders said. At Kaub, cargo vessels could only sail about 50% full, at Duisburg and Cologne between 40-50% full. Traders said no improvement was in immediate sight and water levels could fall further

 

•  The International Grains Council on Thursday raised its forecast for global wheat production in the 2025/26 season, largely reflecting improved crop outlooks in India and Romania. The inter-governmental body, in a monthly update, increased its forecast by 2 million metric tons to 808 million. India’s wheat crop was projected to climb to 117.5 million tons, up from a previous forecast of 115.1 million and the prior season’s 113.3 million. The projection is in line with a forecast issued by India’s government in late May. Romania’s wheat crop forecast was increased to 12.5 million tons, up from last month’s projection of 11.5 million and well above last season’s 10.1 million

 

•  The International Grains Council (IGC) trimmed its forecast for 2025-26 global corn production by 1 MMT to 1.276 billion MT, with Ukraine’s crop downgraded to 28.6 MMT from a previous forecast of 30 MMT. Global corn production is still expected to rise 51 MMT (4.2%) from last year. IGC raised its global wheat production forecast by 2 MMT to 808 MMT. Global wheat production is now expected to rise 9 MMT (1.1%) from last year. This month’s increase largely reflected improved crop outlooks in India and Romania. IGC kept its 2025-26 soybean production forecast at 428 MMT, which would be up 5 MMT (1.2%) from last year

 

•  Brazil’s farmers will produce a record 123.3 million metric tons of second-crop corn. Those numbers are from agribusiness consultancy Agroconsult after finishing a survey of fields in key corn-producing regions. Brazil’s farmers are harvesting the second corn crop now, which will account for 80 percent of national output this year. It’s mainly exported in the second half of the year, competing with U.S. corn suppliers in global markets . Good weather, especially abundant rains through April and May, helped yields in many key growing states. The consultancy said the new forecast represents an increase of 10.4 million tons over a May estimate by Agroconsult

 

•  Chinese companies have booked their first shipment of soybean meal from Argentina since Beijing approved imports from Argentina in 2019, as the Chinese animal feed industry seeks to expand supply options to mitigate potential disruptions from the US-China trade war. Four trade sources told Reuters on Thursday that several Chinese feed makers had signed a joint deal to buy 30,000 tonnes of Argentine soybean meal for delivery in July. “This is just a trial case,” said one Singapore-based trader at an international trading company that sells soybeans to China. “If it passes China’s inspection and quarantine, we expect more deals.” The cargo, bought at $360 a tonne on a cost and freight (CNF) basis, is expected to arrive in the southern province of Guangdong in September, the sources said

 

Shipping & Others

•  Guinea's exports of bauxite, a feedstock for aluminium, surged 39% to a record 48.6 million metric tons in the first quarter though regulatory crackdowns sidelined major operators, official data obtained by Reuters showed. Most of this bauxite was shipped to China, where aluminium production has recovered. In the first five months of the year, China produced 18.59 million tons, a rise of 4.0% from the same period last year, data from its National Bureau of Statistics showed. Shipments from Guinea soared even as an export ban on Emirates Global Aluminium's local unit - which shipped 3.6 million tons in Q1, 2024 - remained in effect, while a regulatory cleanup curtailed exports from other key operators including China Hongqiao's subsidiary AGB2A/SDM

 

•  Pangaea Logistics Solutions is selling the oldest vessel that it acquired in a fleet deal with Strategic Shipping, according to multiple market reports. The Rhode Island-based bulker owner and operator has reached a deal to sell the 33,700-dwt Strategic Endeavor (built 2010), according to a US shipbroker and the VesselsValue database. The sale to an undisclosed buyer is said to have fetched $7.5m. Pangaea executives declined to comment on reports of the transaction. The price tag is in line with value estimates of $7.4m by VesselsValue and $9.2m by Maritime Strategies International for a ship of these characteristics. Among factors that would have impacted that price, the ship is due for dry docking

 

Global Markets 

•  S&P 500 +0.52%, FTSE 100 -0.43% and DAX -0.51% on Monday – U.S. stocks were higher after the close on Monday, as gains in the Telecoms, Financials and Technology sectors led shares higher.

 

•  Nikkei 225 -1.02%, Hang Seng Index closed, and CSI 300 Index +0.00% in Tuesday morning trade – Asian shares opened cautiously and Japanese equities dipped on lingering concerns over the impact from President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda

 

•  The European Union is willing to accept a trade arrangement with the US that includes a 10% universal tariff on many of the bloc’s exports, but wants the US to commit to lower rates on key sectors such as pharmaceuticals, alcohol, semiconductors and commercial aircraft. The EU is also pushing the US for quotas and exemptions to effectively lower Washington’s 25% tariff on automobiles and car parts as well as its 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter

 

•  Japan's manufacturing sector expanded in June for the first time in 13 months led by an upswing in output, but overall demand remained weak as new orders shrank yet again amid uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, a private sector survey showed on Tuesday. The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1 in June from 49.4 in May. Among sub-indexes, factory output grew in June to end a nine-month contraction streak, with some respondents citing hopes of improvements in future demand. Others said the production uptick also reflected a need to reduce backlogs of work, according to the survey

 

•  South Korea's factory activity contracted for the fifth straight month in June, though the pace of decline eased, supported by improving domestic economic prospects under the country's new administration, a business survey showed on Tuesday. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, released by S&P Global, edged up to 48.7 in June, from 47.7 in May. ""Manufacturing output and sales both decreased, albeit at a softer rate than that seen in May, as firms signalled pockets of improvements in the domestic market,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence

 

•  The European Central Bank may not have all the information it needs, including on the trade outlook, by September, making any interest rate cut more likely to come later in the year, ECB policymaker Gediminas Šimkus told Reuters. After cutting interest rates seven times in a row as inflation fell, the ECB has hinted at a pause at its next meeting so it can wait for the fog surrounding trade negotiations between the euro zone and the United States to clear. With these talks still unresolved, Simkus, the Lithuanian central bank governor, said a pause in July was ""very likely"" and signalled the ECB might be on hold for longer

Franc appreciates despite risk-on mood.

By Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst | Swissquote Bank

Last week saw investors put more risk on the table as Middle East tensions de-escalated following a fragile but so far holding US-brokered peace between Israel and Iran. There was also progress on the trade front: the US and China announced they’ve reached a trade agreement that will help restore the flow of Chinese rare earth metals to the US in exchange for trade concessions. VanEck’s Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF jumped nearly 4% and is consolidating gains just below its 200-day moving average (DMA) this morning. Japan and India decided to extend their negotiators’ stays in Washington, raising hopes that the talks are progressing and could lead to more good news in the coming days. Canada rolled back a digital services tax on US companies—imposed just a week earlier—to open the door for softer negotiations. Taiwan said the country made ‘constructive progress’ in the second round of talks, and the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen sounded optimistic that the bloc will find a way to sign a deal to avoid 50% tariffs on European exports to the US.

As such, investors are optimistic and willing to take more risk on their shoulders. The S&P 500 advanced to a fresh record high on Friday, the Nasdaq 100 hit a new record of its own, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest levels since March. The Russell 2000—which had plunged nearly 30% after its November peak—has now recovered more than 60% of those losses and is testing its 200-DMA to the upside. US mid-cap stocks have also broken above their 200-DMA, with momentum improving on the back of falling yields and rising dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) bets, despite the Fed’s persistently cautious tone. Chair Powell repeated last week that the Fed is not willing to rush into rate cuts before having a clearer picture of where inflation is headed amid tariff uncertainty. But that went mostly unheard.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 closed the week on a positive note, ending above both its 50- and 100-DMA, while the FTSE 100 finished just below the 8800-point mark. The Nikkei 225 rallied past the 40,000 level last week on trade optimism and started this week positively as well. However, stocks in China and Hong Kong are still not reacting to the encouraging trade news: both the CSI 300 and the Hang Seng Index are seeing limited demand this Monday, despite the trade truce and better-than-expected PMI data—even though manufacturing activity remained in contraction for a third straight reading.

Overall, market sentiment is upbeat. Investors are pulling back their gold bets, but the Swiss franc remains surprisingly strong and in demand. The USDCHF slipped below the 0.80 mark last Friday and is consolidating under this level —a threshold breached only on rare occasions: once during the European debt crisis in 2011, which forced the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to impose a floor of 1.20 on the EURCHF, and again in January 2015, when the SNB abruptly removed that floor. The fact that the franc's strength persists despite zero rates and broadly positive global market sentiment is a growing concern for the SNB. The franc appears stuck in an appreciation spiral that hurts Swiss exporters. Yet currency intervention is off the table for now, as Switzerland must tread carefully during ongoing trade negotiations with the US—already sensitive after being listed by the US as a potential currency manipulator. So for the time being, Switzerland may have to live with a stronger franc—at least while trade talks continue—and enjoy their discounted summer vacations. But at some point, the franc's strength will need to be addressed to help Swiss economy cope with the loss of competitiveness. The SMI index has been weighed down by tariff uncertainty and franc strength since the beginning of the year, and zero rates have done little to revive investor appetite.

Elsewhere, the US dollar continues to weaken despite trade progress. News that Donald Trump’s so-called ‘beautiful tax bill’ is now headed to the Senate—and, if passed, would add an estimated $3.3 billion to the US debt pile—is undermining appetite for both the dollar and US Treasuries. The 10-year yield briefly rebounded before approaching 4.20% last week.

European investors have increased their incentive to repatriate funds, and the euro is benefiting from sustained appetite for European assets. The EURUSD surpassed the 1.17 mark last week and is consolidating gains above it, despite stronger-than-expected inflation readings from France and Spain on Friday. More inflation data is due today from Germany and Italy, but the eurozone’s aggregate inflation data for June—due tomorrow—is expected to show a 2% print. That would hit the ECB’s target exactly and keep the door open for further support, if needed. The latter remains supportive for the euro.

Other than the European inflation figures and Trump’s tax bill—aimed to pass before the July 4th holiday—the market's attention this week will also turn to the latest US jobs report and a series of final PMI prints. In energy markets, oil prices are worth watching as they give back the Middle East–led gains. WTI crude is sitting on a key Fibonacci support near $65 per barrel—the level that separates the year-to-date bearish trend from a potential medium-term bullish consolidation. Expectations that OPEC may announce a plan to bring more oil to market at its July 6 meeting could give bears the upper hand into the weekend.

Dear All/Samrath

 

Thurlestone Research News Highlights

Monday 30th Jun 2025

 

•  Argentina’s Economy Ministry passed a decree stating that soybean duties will increase from 26% to 33%, corn and sorghum from 9.5% to 12%, while wheat flour will remain at 5.5% from July 1 onwards ↓

 

•  China's industrial profits firms fell 9.1% in May from a year earlier, snapping a two-month growth streak, due to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors"" ↓

 

----------------------------------------------------



 

Freight
•  Capesize 5TC moved -5.3% (-$1,039) to $18,408. MTD at $24,405. YTD at $15,780. Another day marred by decline in the Pacific on the C5 with the big three all closed for business. There was good operator enquiry from both the East and West Coast of Australia but the levels were less than desirable with limited fixtures in the low-mid $6s C5 reported. The ballasters were similarly quiet with just CSN taking Rio’s Cape Venus 209/23 at mid $19s C3 equivalent heard, and not much from the North either. For today, another day of recalibration as owners grapple with selling into this market. The hope will be we find a stable floor to push off from early in the week, and a clear-out with miner support would be a heaven-sent. Although more likely will be the Majors tallying their 2024/25 FY totals and planning maintenance schedules for the near-term. One positive though is that Capes stems are now pricing into the coal flows, giving us a natural springboard whilst Panamax rates remain firm.

 

•  Panamax 5TC moved +1.5% (+$196) to $13,410. MTD at $11,934. YTD at $10,679. Sentiment in the North Atlantic was more positive last week. The transatlantic was more active in the 1H of the week, dominated by NCSA grains and supported by a steady flow of minerals. However, they also saw a tiered market, with more prompt cargoes having to pay up, while shorter mineral runs were heavily discounted with the export season for Baffinland around the corner. The fronthaul also saw healthier rates for NCSA runs well into the $20,000/day BKI equivalent. The ECSA market was more active too with strong fixtures reported for 2H July dates, while earlier dates saw a premium.

 

The Pacific quieted down by Friday, with both East Aussie minerals and Nopac grains sitting at $12,000 vs $13,500 BKI CJK. However, there was a quick drop in demand levels ex East Aussie, with prompter 1H July stems covered and 2H July stems now under threat of a weak C5 market. Fundamentals for Indonesia remained stable with a few fresh cargoes, a shrinking tonnage list in the south, and a stronger ECSA market. However, with the rest of the Pacific feeling a little toppy, stronger rates for Indo in the short term will be dependent on the continued strength of ECSA, and the number of owners which consequently choose to ballast.

 

Commodities

 

Oil

•  Oil prices edged up slightly on Friday, following a report that OPEC+ was planning to hike production in August

 

•  The world's largest group of oil producers, OPEC+, is set to announce another big increase of 411,000 barrels per day in production for August as it looks to regain market share, four delegates from the group told Reuters. If the increase is agreed, it would bring the total rise in supply from OPEC+ to 1.78 million bpd so far this year, equivalent to over 1.5% of total global demand. The group has not yet increased production by the volumes agreed because some members are compensating for previous overproduction and others need longer to bring output back online

 

•  China's oil imports from Iran surged in June as shipments accelerated before the recent conflict between Israel and Iran and demand from independent refineries improved, analysts said. The world's top oil importer and biggest buyer of Iranian crude brought in more than 1.8 million barrels per day from June 1-20, according to ship-tracker Vortexa, a record high based on the firm's data. Kpler's data put the month-to-date average of China's Iranian oil and condensate imports at 1.46 million bpd as of June 27, up from one million bpd in May

 

•  Options markets suggest the probability of a disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz is just 4% following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Thursday. Fears that Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities sent Brent crude futures to a high of $81.40 on Monday, but concerns eased in the wake of the truce declared the next day, sending crude back below $68. The sharp drop in the geopolitical risk premium likely reflected traders' recent experiences with major geopolitical shocks without significant oil disruptions, Iran's restrained response, strong U.S. and China incentives to avoid large disruptions, and the likely shift to large inventory builds from the fall, Goldman analysts said

 

•  Russia's oil pipeline monopoly Transneft's oil flows have continued to decline this year amid the OPEC+ deal and technological challenges, the company's First Deputy CEO Maxim Grishanin said on Friday. In a statement on the company's website, he also said that, due to the turnover decline, revenues will not return to the levels typical of the past 10 years until around 2030. CEO Nikolai Tokarev said Transneft shipped 447 million metric tons (around 8.94 million barrels per day) of oil in 2024, including 435 million tons of Russian oil and 12 million tons of oil from Kazakhstan. The total flows were down from 460 million tons in 2023

 

Iron Ore

•  Iron ore prices rose on Friday off falling iron ore and steel inventories, outweighing Taiwan anti-dumping duties

 

•  Brazil's Vale one of the world's largest iron ore producers, has decided how to spend half of the planned 70 billion reais ($12.78 billion) in investments under its ""New Carajas Program,"" according to a company director, who discussed details of the five-year plan with journalists this week. Gildiney Sales, director of the mining company’s North corridor, said some of the projects are in the execution phase. He added that Vale is now seeking new ""targets"" under the program to expand mines and increase its iron ore output to 200 million tons annually at the Carajas mining site, in addition to increasing local copper extraction by 32%

 

•  Japan's iron ore imports fell by 16pc on the year to 7mn t in May, mostly because of lower shipments from the country's major suppliers including Australia. Japan's iron ore imports from its top supplier Australia fell by 22pc on the year to 3.3mn t, data released by the country's finance ministry on 27 June show. Purchases from Brazil, the country's second-largest iron ore supplier, fell to 2.4mn t, down by 22pc from a year earlier. Japan imports mostly agglomerated or non-agglomerated iron ore and Brazil is the largest supplier of the former, for which deliveries slightly fell by 1.4pc on the year to 430,611t. Imports from Canada more than doubled on the year to 719,535t

 

•  Australia cut its forecast earnings from commodity exports, as a meteoric rise in gold prices fails to offset weakness in iron ore and natural gas. Iron ore continues to be Australia’s biggest income earner, at about 30 per cent of the total. While shipments will rise, declining grades and falling prices mean earnings for the commodity will slip below A$100 billion in 2026 to 2027 for the first time this decade

 

•  Mineral Resources (MinRes) has finalised the sale of its Yilgarn iron ore hub in Western Australia to Yilgarn Iron Investments. Yilgarn Iron Investments also acquired all shares in Yilgarn Iron, and other tenements and land interests, approvals, licences, entitlements and fixed assets across the Yilgarn Hub. MinRes has retained all gold and lithium rights on tenements within the Yilgarn Hub, wherever applicable. “As we transfer our Yilgarn operations to a new owner, we take great pride in everything the MinRes team has achieved in the region over the past 14 years, and that we were able to save hundreds of jobs at Koolyanobbing that would have otherwise been lost with the departure of Cleveland Cliffs,” MinRes managing director Chris Ellison said

 

Steel

•  Brazil has sharply reduced its annual import quotas for 13 steel products, making it more likely for those imports to become subject to a 25pc tariff. The government cut the total quota volume for the June 2025-May 2026 period by nearly 250,000 metric tonnes(t)/yr from a year prior to curb a surge in foreign shipments and support domestic producers, the industry and trade ministry said on 24 June. That leaves about 1.43mn t/yr subject to the quotas, which pay tariffs of 9-11pc. Brazil also targeted boron-added steel previously used as a workaround to avoid higher tariffs, levying 25pc tariffs on four more steel products

 

•  Taiwan's Ministry of Finance will impose anti-dumping duties on beer and hot-rolled steel from China for four months, starting next Thursday. This decision follows investigations that found these products were being dumped, causing substantial damage to Taiwan's domestic industry. Tariffs on Chinese beer will range from 13.13% to 64.14%, while steel tariffs will be either 16.9% or 20.15%

 

•  The China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) has announced that in mid-June (June 11-20) this year the average aggregate daily crude steel output of large and medium-sized steel enterprises in China - all CISA members - totaled 2.148 million mt, down 0.5 percent compared to early June (June 1-10) this year. In early June, the average aggregate daily crude steel output of large and medium-sized steel enterprises in China had totaled 2.159 million mt, up 3.2 percent compared to late May (May 21-31) this year. Inventory levels of the large and medium-sized steel enterprises in China increased in the given period

 

•  Overall, China’s domestic iron ore concentrates resources remain tight. In the past half-month, domestic iron ore concentrates prices have fallen collectively, and the cost-effectiveness of domestic ore has improved. Currently, pig iron production of steel mill blast furnaces remains at a high level. After the implementation of the coke price cut, steel mill profits have increased, and steel mills' purchasing enthusiasm has improved compared to the previous period. It is expected that there will be some rebound space in domestic iron ore concentrates prices next week

 

•  Vietnam-based Xuan Thien Group has announced that it has started construction of its Nam Dinh green steel plant in the Nghia Hung district. The plant will use electricity and natural gas instead of coke to be environmentally friendly. The project will be completed in June 2030. The plant, which will have an annual production capacity of 9.5 million mt, will produce mainly high-quality steel such as weather-resistant steel, super-thick large-size cast steel plates, which are qualified for supply for the mechanical engineering industry, shipbuilding, wind power pole production, and car body production. The first steel product is scheduled to be produced in June 2028

 

Coal

•  Australian rail operator Aurizon's Central Queensland Coal Network will have facilitated about 207mn t of exports in the 2024-25 financial year to 30 June, down by around 4.6pc on the year, because of weather and safety issues. The company's rail access contracts operate on a take-or-pay basis, where coal producers pay for unused capacity. But those provisions will only impact mines along Aurizon's Blackwater system — including global producer Glencore's Oaky Creek, Australian producer Whitehaven Coal's Blackwater, and US-Australian producer Coronado's Curragh mines — the company told investors on 27 June

 

•  According to SMM tracking, China’s total coal port arrivals last week were 6.1324 million mt, up 850,400 mt MoM. By product type, coking coal port arrivals were 1.2145 million mt, down 52,700 mt MoM; coke port arrivals were 0 mt, down 0 mt MoM. According to SMM tracking, the total coal port departures last week were 28.0418 million mt, down 215,600 mt MoM. By product type, coking coal port departures were 11.4112 million mt, down 1.3049 million mt MoM; coke port departures were 211,700 mt, up 114,900 mt MoM

 

•  Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd, is all set to increase its annual coal production by 35 million tonnes with the launch of two new opencast mines—Subhadra and Balbhadra—in Odisha’s Talcher coalfield. The Subhadra Opencast Project will add 25 million tonnes to MCL’s capacity and is scheduled to begin production by FY2025–26. The Balbhadra mine, which will contribute 10 million tonnes, is expected to become operational by FY2029–30

 

•  India, one of the key buyers of Russian thermal coal, increased its imports from Russia in May to the highest level in two years, business daily Kommersant reported on Friday. The Russian thermal coal deliveries to India rose by 52 per cent in May 2025 compared to April, reaching a two-year high of 1.3 million metric tons, reported Kommersant quoting a business review by the Russian Centre for Price Indices (CCI). Records reveal since June 2023, monthly exports from Russia have not exceeded 1 million tons. Analysts interviewed by the Daily attribute this trend to the flexible pricing strategies adopted by Russian coal exporters, as well as the quality of the fuel itself

 

•  This week's Market Monitor highlights a notable shift in thermal coal trade flows, particularly in the evolving import strategies of China and India. According to the latest dry bulk flow data, Indonesia continues to account for 48% of global thermal coal exports, with Taboneo and Muara Berau remaining the most active origin terminals. However. Chinese and Indian buyers are increasingly turning to higher-grade coal alternatives from countries such as Australia and Russia. This trend appears to be mainly driven by the current downturn in global coal prices, which has made energy- dense coal from non-Indonesian sources more cost-competitive

 

•  Peabody, a US-based coal giant, has extended the lockout of workers at the Helensburgh underground coal mine until 6 July, in response to a one-hour protected industrial action by the miners. The Mining and Energy Union (MEU) is now urging the federal government to address workplace laws that permit such disproportionate employer actions against workers’ bargaining rights. Members of the MEU at Metropolitan Mine have been barred from work without pay by Peabody since 18 June. The miners, who anticipated returning to work on Thursday, were informed on the preceding Wednesday evening of the extended lockout

 

Gas

•  A liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessel called Iris that has been sanctioned by the U.S. berthed at Russia's Arctic LNG 2 plant on Thursday, shiptracking data from LSEG and Kpler showed. If the vessel picks up gas, it would mark the ninth LNG cargo to be offloaded from the Arctic LNG 2 project, according to Kpler data. The last shipment was picked up by the Arctic Metagaz vessel on October 5. In October, the U.S. state department imposed sanctions on registered owners and managers of several LNG vessels including Iris, which was previously known as North Sky

 

•  Iran has resumed operations at a gas treatment plant at phase 14 of its giant South Pars offshore gas field, after the facility was damaged in an Israeli drone strike earlier this month, state news agency Shana said. The 14 June attack disrupted gas production. But injection from phase 14 ""into the national pipeline"" has now resumed, Shana said, citing the chief executive of state-owned Pars Oil and Gas. A separate Israeli strike also damaged the Fajr-e-Jam gas processing plant, which handles gas from both South Pars and the Kangan field

 

•  Japan's largest power generation company JERA sees a need to secure 16 million mt/year long-term LNG contracts in the 2030s, Yukio Kani, global CEO and chairman, said June 27. ""Looking at the 2030s, about 16 million tons[/year] of existing [long-term LNG supply] contracts will expire,"" Kani told a press conference in Tokyo. ""If LNG demand doesn't change much, we will need to significantly replenish our LNG procurement,"" Kani said, adding that the company's long-term LNG supply contracts total about 25 million-26 million mt/year currently. ""If electricity demand increases, the situation changes even further,"" he said, adding the company had recently secured 5.5 million mt/year of LNG from the US Gulf Coast

 

Grains

•  India's annual monsoon rains covered the entire country on Sunday, nine days earlier than is typical, the weather department said, bringing forward planting of summer-sown crops. The monsoon is the lifeblood of India's nearly $4 trillion economy, delivering almost 70% of the rainfall needed to water farms and replenishing aquifers and reservoirs. Nearly half of India's farmland is not irrigated and depends on the annual June-September rains for crop growth. The southwest monsoon has further advanced into the remaining northwestern parts of the country, effectively covering the entire country nine days ahead of schedule, the India Meteorological Department said in a statement

 

•  Egypt has begun shutting down some local wheat collection centres ahead of schedule, signalling that the harvest is nearing its end with purchases falling short of the government's target, according to a supply ministry document seen by Reuters. The shortfall comes as Egypt, often the world's largest wheat importer, seeks to secure affordable supplies for a vast subsidised bread programme that feeds nearly 70 million people, amid high inflation and ongoing economic strains. The government had aimed to procure between 4 and 5 million metric tons of wheat from a local harvest it estimated at around 10 million tons

 

•  Growth of Brazil's corn ethanol sector has become key to meeting the country's growing demand for the renewable fuel under a new government mandate to use more ethanol in gasoline, even as sugarcane-based ethanol output has stagnated. Brazil is the world's largest producer of ethanol from sugarcane, but output has flattened since the turn of the decade, while corn ethanol production has more than tripled, according to data from sugar and ethanol industry group UNICA. In the 2024/25 cycle, corn ethanol output in Brazil's center-south region rose nearly 31% from the year before to 8.19 billion liters, according to an UNICA report

 

•  Argentina’s Economy Ministry passed a decree restoring soybean and corn export duties to their January values from July 1 onwards. Barley and wheat will remain subject to lower duties until next year. The government had already confirmed that the reductions would be temporary, but the move dashes the hopes of producers who had been holding out for a last-minute change of heart. Friday’s decree established that export duties on wheat and barley will remain at 9.5% until March 31, 2026. Soybean duties will increase from 26% to 33%, corn and sorghum from 9.5% to 12%, and sunflower from 5.5% to 7%. Wheat flour will remain at 5.5%

 

Shipping & Others

•  Fire crews have been battling a blaze on a ship in Hull port in an incident which has caused significant disruption in the city. Four fire engines were dispatched to tackle the flames following the incident on board the 7,400-dwt Altay (built 2006), the emergency services said. The ship caught fire on Friday morning, capturing the attention of regional and national media. The cause is as yet unknown. People in the UK city are being advised to keep their windows and doors closed from a ship fire emitting huge plumes of smoke in the port

 

Global Markets 

•  S&P 500 +0.52%, FTSE 100 +0.72% and DAX +1.62% on Friday – The S&P 500 hit fresh records on Friday as traders managed to look past new comments from President Donald Trump tied to U.S.-Canada tariffs

 

•  Nikkei 225 +1.52%, Hang Seng Index -0.04%, and CSI 300 Index -0.04% in Monday morning trade – Asia shares firmed on Monday as seemingly unquenchable demand for technology companies lifted S&P 500 futures to another all-time peak

 

•  China's industrial profits swung back into sharp decline in May from a year earlier, as factory activity slowed in the face of broader economic stress and a fragile trade truce with the United States. Profits at China's industrial firms fell 9.1% in May from a year earlier, snapping a two-month growth streak, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Friday. The profit decline was due to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors,"" said NBS statistician Yu Weining in a statement

 

•  The Indian economy will grow at a mostly steady pace this fiscal year and next after marking a four-year low in 2024-25, according to economists polled by Reuters, who have mostly either kept their forecasts unchanged or made marginal upgrades. ""Most of the growth that was happening was mainly because of the capital expenditures of the government, which will flatten out,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Yes Bank. Private sector spending is still trailing far behind, and analysts generally agree the economy is still failing to create enough quality jobs for its large young population

 

•  Japanese factory output rose at a slower pace than expected in May, government data showed on Monday, as sweeping U.S. tariffs were threatening to derail the country's already fragile economic recovery. Industrial output rose 0.5% in May from the previous month, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed, less than a median market forecast for a 3.5% rise. Manufacturers surveyed by METI expect seasonally adjusted output to rise 0.3% in June and fall 0.7% in July

Asia-Pacific Panamax freight rates were flat to a tick higher on June 27 amid finely balanced tonnage supply and demand.

 

According to sources, market participants adopted a wait-and-watch approach, awaiting clearer indications of market direction for the next week. Meanwhile, trading activity was limited, partially due to ongoing holidays in Indonesia and Dubai. Freight derivative rates ticked up during Asian trading hours, while bunker prices edged up from the previous session.

 

""[The Pacific basin] is still firm, but [we are] seeing less activity with Dubai on holiday,"" a shipbroker source said.

 

A ship-operator source added, ""There's not as much trading activity with most cargoes covered earlier in the week.""

 

On the Australia-India coal route, Steel Authority of India Limited was heard to have fixed a 75,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) metallurgical coal cargo from Hay Point in east Australia to Vizag and Haldia on the east coast of India for July 25-Aug. 3 laycan, at $16.70/mt.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate to move 75,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of metallurgical coal from Hay Point to Paradip on the east coast of India at $15.25/mt June 27, and to Qingdao in China at $13.75/mt, both unchanged from June 26.

 

On the Indonesia-China coal route, trading information was scant on June 27.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate to move 65,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of coal from Samarinda in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province to Guangzhou in China at $6.40/mt June 27, up 10 cents/mt from June 26.

 

On the Indonesia-India coal route, no fresh fixtures were heard on June 27.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate to move 75,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of thermal coal from Banjarmasin in Indonesia's South Kalimantan province to Krishnapatnam on India’s east coast at $8.25/mt June 27, and to Mundra on India’s west coast at $9/mt, both up 5 cents/mt from June 26.

 

Out of the Indian Ocean, Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel was heard to be in the market with a 75,000-mt (plus/minus 10%) limestone cargo from Mina Saqr in the UAE to Hazira on the west coast of India for July 4-7 laycan.

2025-06-30,FW: Market Commentary : Capesize market slides further on persistently weak outlook,"

Sent: Monday, June 30, 2025 9:54:07 AM (UTC+08:00) Kuala Lumpur, Singapore
Subject: Market Commentary : Capesize market slides further on persistently weak outlook











 

The Capesize market continued its downward trajectory on June 27, weighed by persistently soft sentiment and limited trading activity. Market sources expressed disappointment over the lack of firm transactions, noting that the brief uptick in Pacific activity observed on June 26 proved to be a false dawn, as trading momentum slowed to a near halt.

 

In the Pacific, a healthy volume of coal cargoes and a handful of iron ore requirements were available among traders and operators. Some additional iron ore cargoes were cleared post-Asian trading hours on June 26. However, the absence of Western Australian iron ore miners left the Pacific market subdued, with sources describing activity in the basin as ""quiet.""

 

During the H2 Asian trading hours, indicative Capesize bid levels on the Western Australia-China route were heard at around mid-$6/wmt. Later, unconfirmed reports suggested a Capesize ship was fixed from Western Australia to the Far East for June 10 onward laycan at approximately $6.65/wmt.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Western Australia to Qingdao at $6.60/wmt on June 27, down 30 cents/wmt from June 26.

 

Activity was lackluster out of Atlantic overnight, as market participants held back from firm trading amid a sharp downward correction in the Pacific in the previous session, which ended June 26.

 

Among North Atlantic fronthaul inquiries, an indicative offer of around low-$27/wmt was heard for moving 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) iron ore cargo from Sept-Îles to Qingdao for July 13-19 laycan.

 

Among overnight Brazil fixtures, Polaris was heard to have fixed a Capesize ship from Tubarao to Qingdao for July 20-30 laycan but rate details were not confirmed.

 

A shipbroker source pointed out that offer levels were easing significantly on the Brazil-China route, with a backwardation trend in rates remaining evident between the July and August loading window.

 

Among Brazil cargoes, NYK and Smart Gain were heard seeking ships from Tubarao to Qingdao for July 21-25 and Aug. 1-5 laycans, respectively. Indicative Capesize offers on said route were heard in excess of $20/wmt for late July onward laycan.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao to Qingdao at $20.40/wmt on June 27, down 85 cents/wmt from June 26.

 

Activity out of South Africa remained minimal.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay to Qingdao at $16.25/wmt on June 27, down 40 cents/wmt from June 26.

Baltic Exchange Market Report 30 June 2025


Baltic Dry Index: 1489 (-32)
Baltic Capesize Index: 2111 (-109)
Baltic Panamax Index: 1500 (10)
Baltic Supramax Index: 1012 (3)
Baltic Handysize Index: 635 (-1)



CAPESIZE


The Capesize market began the week on a sluggish note, with the BCI 5TC falling by $898 to close at $17,510. In the Pacific, activity remained limited, though two miners re-entered the market, contributing to a slightly firmer tone. The cargo list showed promising growth, with solid volumes ex-West Australia to China and a handful of coal stems from East Coast Australia. Rates edged up, with reports of $6.90 paid by a miner and later bids nearing the $7.00 mark, helping the C5 index gain 0.235 to $6.905. In the Atlantic, the tone was quieter, with subdued activity from South Brazil and West Africa to China. Discussions on C3 for index dates (20–30 July) were limited, while offers for forward dates hovered around the mid-$19.00s. The C3 index eased by 0.950 to $19.985.

Asia
BHP fixed a TBN for 160,000/10 Port Hedland to Qingdao 15/17 July at $6.90, lacking further details. The Bocimar controlled Mineral Deutschland (210,707 2024) won the Baosteel tender for 210.000/10 Dampier/Qingdao 14/23 July at $7.11.


PANAMAX


A minor improvement of $92 saw the BPI timecharter average close at $13,502 with some pockets of firm sentiment seen in some parts. In reality it returned a typical slow opening for the market, the Atlantic remained very much fronthaul trip centric with early support seen as the week opened, some suggestion by some that this was dragging some of the trans-Atlantic exchanges up with it but remained a watching brief. Asia remained mixed, Australian coal demand continued to pave the way, but elsewhere a muted opening in the basin with little fresh demand seen.

Atlantic
Louis Dreyfus placed unnamed LME tonnage on subjects for a trip via EC South America & Egypt Red Sea 13/24 July but little else came to light. 

Asia
The Caravos Harmony (81,631 2013) Port Dickson 2 July was heard fixed and failed for a West Australian round trip, further details unknown. Messrs Raffles placed on subjects Kamsarmax for a trip via EC Australia redelivery Malaysia 15 July onwards, however further details had yet to surface.


SUPRAMAX


A typical Monday with limited fresh enquiry coming into the market. Having said that overall, the Atlantic seemed a bit more positive as owners hold off committing to see how things pane out. From Asia, a bit of a slow start with some saying that the recent push from the north might have ended. Further south rates remained fairly steady whilst from the Indian Ocean again activity remained limited. The 11 TC average did however closed up $48 at $12,796.

Atlantic
The Li Da Shun (56,897 2010) Eregli was linked to Efe covering a vessel for a trip via Constanta redelivery Aqaba at $14,500. Otherwise, little was heard.

Asia
From the end of last week came the news that the Big Glory (64,640 2021) Koh Sichang fixed a trip via Indonesia redelivery India at $14,000 but no more details surfaced. JSPL were also said to have fixed there $9,500 coal stem from Muara Berau to Paradip for 1/5 July dates at $13.80 pmt again no more details surfaced.



HANDYSIZE


The week began on a mostly flat note, with positional sentiment prevailing across regions. The BHSI opened at 635, while the 7TC average edged down by $23 to settle at $11,426. In the Continent and Mediterranean, limited fresh information surfaced, and rates held steady around recent levels. The South Atlantic also remained subdued, with rates maintaining a stable tone. However, in the U.S. Gulf, reduced inquiry for prompt tonnage created downward pressure on bids. In Asia, a slight shift in the cargo-to-tonnage balance contributed to a modest upward trend in rates. On the period front, The MDS Sofia (37,405 2012) open Dunkirk fixed 3/5 months redelivery Atlantic at $10,500 by Cobelfret, but further details were not disclosed.

Atlantic
The HSL Geraldton (40,528 2025) open Altamira was placed on subjects to West Coast $17,000 aps basis by Cargill and the Neptulus (33,706 2012) fixed trip via W Mediterranean to US Gulf at $7,000 by Centurion, but further details were not disclosed. Also heard a 39,000 fixed delivery UK redelivery Mediterranean with scrap at $9,000 and a 34,000 fixed delivery Türkiye Mediterranean trip redelivery Caribbean-US Gulf at $9,000 first 45 days thereafter $12,000, again lacking further details.

Asia
The Vast Lucky (32,115 2009) was heard fixed delivery Samalaju for three laden legs at $11,000 by Pacific Basin but further details were not disclosed. Additionally, a TBN heard fixed a voyage for the 30,000 10% IOP from Bahrain to Sohar laycan 1/4 July at $5.25 pmt, but further details were not surfaced.

2025-07-01,"FW: Market Commentary : Pacific Capesize freight rebound, Atlantic market slips","

Subject: Market Commentary : Pacific Capesize freight rebound, Atlantic market slips











 

Pacific Capesize freight rates rebounded on June 30, while the Atlantic market slipped against a backdrop of freight derivative rates trading at losses in late Asian trading hours.

 

Sources predominantly expressed relief with a marked improvement in cargo volumes, providing impetus to the resumption of livelier Pacific activity on the day. ""Owners seem to be exhibiting greater resistance today,"" a shipbroker source said, suggesting shipowners were more optimistic for a market rebound and reluctant to give in to low bid levels.

 

Out of the Pacific, a plethora of fresh coal and iron ore cargoes circulated among operators and traders after an extremely slow week ending June 27. Moreover, the duo of BHP and Rio Tinto, among Western Australia mining majors, were heard seeking ships, supporting tonnage demand and propping up market confidence.

 

In H2 Asian trading hours, initial indicative Capesize offers on the Western Australia-China route were heard in excess of mid-$7/wmt. As the trading day progressed, offer levels were heard trending down to around $7/wmt, with indicative bids heard in the mid- to high $6/wmt.

 

In late Asian trading hours, BHP was heard to have fixed a few Capesize ships from Port Hedland to Qingdao for July 15-17 laycan at around $6.90/wmt. Rio Tinto was also heard to have taken two Capesize ships from Dampier to Qingdao for July 14-16 laycan, both in the high $6/wmt.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Western Australia to Qingdao at $6.90/wmt on June 30, up 30 cents/wmt from June 27.

 

Meanwhile, activity was fairly scant out of the Atlantic during H2 Asian trading hours. Fixtures were also limited post-Asian trading hours from the previous session, which ended June 27. Some shipowners have decided to ballast Pacific tonnages toward the Atlantic amid poor activity out of the Pacific in the previous trading week, which might, in turn, depress rate levels exchanged out of the Atlantic, sources said.

 

Among South Atlantic fixtures, CSN was heard to have fixed a 180,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) iron ore from Itaguai to Qingdao for July 31-Aug 7 at around mid-high $19/wmt on June 27.

 

Among Brazil requirements, Koch was heard seeking a Capesize ship from Tubarao to Qingdao for Aug. 1-7 laycan. An indicative Capesize bid in the low to mid-$18/wmt was heard on the same route for Aug. 1-10 laycan.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao to Qingdao at $19.45/wmt on June 30, down 95 cents/wmt from June 27.

 

Activity was thin out of South Africa on the day.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay to Qingdao at $15.35/wmt on June 30, down 90 cents/wmt from June 27.

In H2 Asian trading hours, initial indicative Capesize offers on the Western Australia-China route were heard in excess of mid-$7/wmt. As the trading day progressed, offer levels were heard trending down to around $7/wmt, with indicative bids heard in the mid- to high $6/wmt.

 

In late Asian trading hours, BHP was heard to have fixed a few Capesize ships from Port Hedland to Qingdao for July 15-17 laycan at around $6.90/wmt. Rio Tinto was also heard to have taken two Capesize ships from Dampier to Qingdao for July 14-16 laycan, both in the high $6/wmt.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Western Australia to Qingdao at $6.90/wmt on June 30, up 30 cents/wmt from June 27.

 

Meanwhile, activity was fairly scant out of the Atlantic during H2 Asian trading hours. Fixtures were also limited post-Asian trading hours from the previous session, which ended June 27. Some shipowners have decided to ballast Pacific tonnages toward the Atlantic amid poor activity out of the Pacific in the previous trading week, which might, in turn, depress rate levels exchanged out of the Atlantic, sources said.

 

Among South Atlantic fixtures, CSN was heard to have fixed a 180,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) iron ore from Itaguai to Qingdao for July 31-Aug 7 at around mid-high $19/wmt on June 27.

 

Among Brazil requirements, Koch was heard seeking a Capesize ship from Tubarao to Qingdao for Aug. 1-7 laycan. An indicative Capesize bid in the low to mid-$18/wmt was heard on the same route for Aug. 1-10 laycan.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Tubarao to Qingdao at $19.45/wmt on June 30, down 95 cents/wmt from June 27.

 

Activity was thin out of South Africa on the day.

 

Platts assessed the freight rate for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Saldanha Bay to Qingdao at $15.35/wmt on June 30, down 90 cents/wmt from June 27.

Asia-Pacific Supramax freight rates were mixed June 30 as market participants pointed to a typical trend at the start of the trading week.

G M S [CUMBERLAND] - World's Largest Buyer of Ships & Offshore Vessels

 

 

 

  


-- MARKET COMMENTARY -- 


 

HKC IN FORCE!

 

After decades of ongoing efforts, the Hong Kong Convention (HKC) finally entered into force this week with big changes underway for the industry, particularly in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani markets who still have a lot of work to do and catch up to the strides India has already made in upgrading their facilities over the last decade. This is certainly great news for stakeholders, ship owners, cash buyers, recyclers, and the environment at large, as positive strides at improving industry standards will further serve as a catalyst in the crucial circular world of shipping, we are all in today.

 

Of course, in the short term, there is likely to be a testy period of transition whilst everyone in the industry gets accustomed to the changing regulations, inward formality procedures, and additional documents required when a vessel is being transacted for HKC recycling from here on. Of note, documentation and procedures might change as the initial phase in period settles. In the interim however, owners / cash buyers seeking to deliver units into the Indian sub-continent ship recycling markets will now have to include IHM reports part I, II and III, along with a ‘Ready for Recycling’ certificate from the relevant flag state, all gift wrapped in the yard specific HKC and ISO certification by various classes. Owners now need to ensure these formalities are timed well with the arrival of the vessel in order to avoid unintended delays and potentially miss beaching tides. 

 

At the Macro end of the spectrum, we continue to see the fallout from the recent attacks in Iran as oil has been the biggest beneficiary of global sufferance as it tumbled over 11% just last week, ending it at about USD 66/barrel. The U.S. Dollar is similarly getting hammered as it reported barely any negative changes against any of the recycling nation currencies (except Turkey). The supply of tonnage at the bidding table on the other hand, seems to be gearing up again as some older units continues to slip into the recycling stream (as confirmed by Bangladesh’s and even India’s waterfronts this week), as freight rates declined over 2.1% and the Cape index declining the most last week at 5.3%. Trade wars continue, major ports return to turning empty for the most part, and economies are bracing for the next thoughtless policy out of the White House. 

 

Meanwhile, prices and demand have slumped over the last couple of months and continue to do so, in the lead up to the HKC even though we have seen few private sales realized through it all, it’s clear that both owners and cash buyers are chasing down a market and will likely continue to. Local steel plate prices are declining at the most convenient locations while flatlining in others and port reports in key locations (except Bangladesh) are turning sour through the rains. As tariff ping pong continues, Trump surprisingly confirmed trade deals being done with India, which should help this market in the near future given the incessant spiral state its plate and currency has been in.

 

Turkey, we just have nothing left to add other than the same ole’ bad news.

UPDATE: VESSELS BERTHING

Please take note that no vessels to dock under free pratique or Port Health  withheld unless confirmed by HM management.

 

TNPA Security - Incomplete Vessel Gangway Registers

The register changed after we had a serious incident (armed robbery) on board a vessel at 700 series, it seems the very people the system in put in place to assist/protect  are not-complying in completing the access control gangway  registers.

 

Correct personal information is a precursor to the commencement of a competent investigation. So in an event of an incident on-board a vessel we will spend hours and sometime days trying to identify people because the access register is half completed or identification numbers are not added or incorrectly added. 

 

Please communicate this to all Agents and their Security Gangway service providers as well. 

 

CREW CHANGES

 

SIGN ON AND SIGN OFF OF SUPERNUMERIES ,TECHNICIANS FROM VESSELS

 

In consultation with Mr Vanu Naidoo, Director of Home Affairs KZN, he has advised that on checking with his head office in Pretoria, the sign on and sign off of supernumeraries and technicians may be undertaken provided proof that the 72 hour COVID testing process was undertaken proving negative that he has a valid passport, contracting  letter from his company and complies with all Immigration and Port Health protocols in place. Based on these requirements it will no longer be necessary to apply to the minister for approval.

 

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

GALLY WASTE REMOVAL:

All mandatory fees that were charged on vessels before COVID-19 were reinstated when the suspension (of galley waste removal) was lifted. Everything is now normal. To ensure that we don’t end –up with waste that is not declared, we instructed the service provider to keep the cages locked and collect directly from the vessels. The refuse removal fee (standard) will be charged whether  the vessel utilized the service or not as per the normal procedure.

 

OPL’S

OPL jobs are ongoing but restricted to essential services and daylight only.

 

NO STOWAWAYS WILL BE REMOVED IN ANY SA PORTS

 

STOWAWAY SEARCH – ONBOARD

Stowaway Search & Quayside Watchmen continues as per normal.

 

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

SHIP SPARES

Ongoing as normal ex. Johannesburg, South Africa but expect delays with consignments stuck in countries where flights are restricted.

 

BUNKERS

Ongoing as normal.

Bunkers supplied via bunker barge only, alongside at the suitable berth.

 

 

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

CUSTOMS 

Customs officials No longer be boarding vessels, therefore Agents to scan vessel required/certification to their general email address.

The delivery outside box is utilized for Vessels Clearances.

Their present office/operating times are from 07:00 to 19:00 daily, until further notice.

 

IMMIGRATIONS

2025-06-30,RE: Norden / S&P Global - FRF Analyst Call ,"Dear Norden Team,

Thank you for your query on the reasons behind the quarter-on-quarter change to our West Africa iron ore trade forecast. The changes are primarily attributed to the following factors:

 

1.	We have revised Guinea's annual shipment projections downward from 2026 onwards, based on insights gathered during the Singapore International Ferrous Week conference last May. We anticipate a more gradual ramp-up of the Simandou project due to expected challenges in rail infrastructure development, along with the likelihood that not all mined ore will be shipped.
2.	The Gabon forecast has been nullified from this year onward concerning the Belinga Iron Ore Project, based on insights from our analyst's visit to FMG in Australia.
3.	Conversely, we have observed strong shipments from Liberia, supported by the iron ore expansion project undertaken by ArcelorMittal.

 

Please find attached link to the Africa Iron Ore report published in April: S&P Global Commodities at Sea Insight (Iron Ore) - Africa (28 April 2025) <https://connect.spglobal.com/document/show/phoenix/5991834?connectPath=CAS.Documents> 

Kindly let us know if you require further clarification.

Thank you.

Hi Lionel,

 

Our API is functioning properly however we suspect that your Personal Access Token (PAT) may have expired which is why you’re not able to access the API service. Could you please delete your current PAT and create a new one? Here’s how to do this:

 

Log in to the Connect platform using a web browser.

 

Go to the dropdown for your user profile in the upper right corner and click on “Personal Access Tokens.”

 



 

On the main Personal Access Tokens screen, you will find a list of all PATs assigned to your account.

 

To delete a PAT, select the row for the PAT and click the “Delete” action button.

 



 

To create a new token, click on “+ New Token” in the upper left and follow the prompts:

 

Description: Specify what the PAT will be used for.

Expiration Date: Please select the ‘Never Expire’ option.

Services: Choose from the list of available S&P Global (IHS Markit) services where your PAT will be valid.

 



 

After clicking “Create,” you will be provided with the username and password for this PAT. Please make sure to copy these credentials to a safe place, as you will not be able to see them again after closing this window.

 

You can find the documentation with instructions about Personal Access Tokens in the CAS Documentation section.

 



 

Please let us know if this resolves the issue. If you need assistance, we can set up a call to guide you through this process.

Hi Abhimanyu,

 

I hope you are doing well.

 

Just wanted to follow up on this week’s set of files. We haven’t received it yet and wanted to see if there might be any delays or if there’s anything we can assist with.

 

Appreciate all the hard work the team put into ensuring we have this latest information. Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi Kevin,

As requested, we have added “Russia – Black Sea” to Black Sea along with already present “Black Sea”.

PFA updated Trade_Metrics_Dirty file.

Thanks,

Many thanks Subho! 

 

Appreciated the support.

 

In the next refresh, could you kindly update the rule for the BlackSea tabs in Trade_Metrics_dirty? As I can see we have many 0s results. The reason could be that in Trade_Metrics, we have to select the region “Russia - Black Sea” too.

 

Please include both “Black Sea” and “Russia-Black Sea” in next week’s update for BlackSea results in Trade Metrics_dirty. 

 

Many thanks.

 

Best Rgds,

Kevin

Hi Subho,

 

Many thanks for sharing!

 

While reviewing the data I found that in the trade metrics files, the min_date_ping for the data extracted are set as Sundays (i.e., 2023-12-31). As previously advised, we would appreciate if you could keep the consistence and extract the data as Saturdays (i.e., 2023-12-30), as per last week’s practice.

 

Could you kindly re-share the adjusted data? Look forward to hearing from you soon.

 

 

Best Rgds,

Kevin

Hi Kevin,

 

We are facing issues accessing our EC2 instances from the morning today. Since, we run all our codes in EC2, we will be able to share the files for today only after the issue is resolved. 

 

As for Ballast Analytics, we are still working on it and would try to complete it soon. We will let you know once it is completed.

 

Thanks,

Subho

Hi Nikesh,

You are correct. We found a code bug that is causing this issue in the Speed Analytics files. I have regenerated all files and uploaded at the usual location.


Thanks,

Hi Fotios, 

I have incorporated the port name standardized. But I see there are new variations came up.
This can become a cause of concern as we will need to update these port with region every week before we run ballast analytics data extraction.

I am attaching this week’s unmatched port region.

let me know your thought if we want to update these every week?

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Just want to check with you on the status of the data refresh. Please let us know when the files can be ready and let us know once this is done. It would be great if you can apply changes in the update (pulling 0 results out as well, include Russia-Baltic, etc.) as mentioned in below email.

 

Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi, Sachin

 

I'll share the list of ports during the day with you. Apologies for the delay. Meanwhile, let us know if there have been more ports added to the list so far.

Hi Kevin, 

 

I am working on the changes, I’ll send the files for Congestion, Trade Matric and Data Query today. 

I will also try to complete speed analytics tab today. 

I am waiting for the port region mapping for the ports which I shared couple of weeks back. I’ll use that to work on ballast analytics.

Hi Sachin, 

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

We found out that the data in some sheets (especially the trade metrics) with the most recent week always show a significant drop. If we double check the dashboard, the data will improve and rise to a more logical level from Tuesday onwards that could better reflect the actual levels. 

 

We believe it can be improved by changing the definition of weeks. In the next update, could you kindly adjust the “start of the week” to Saturday? We understand we are using Sundays now. 

 

Please let us know if this can be applied in our next update. Happy to schedule a call to discuss this too along with our advices last week if needed.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

For the shared trade metrics and congestion file, please kindly find below feedback:

 

1.	Names of some sheets in the trade metrics file (both clean and dirty) are not showed correctly. Could you kindly check the reason of this? It seems the sheets were recovered, will this cause potential data loss? The sheets’ names are as follows:
	Trade Metrics Clean

Aframax/LR2 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet1

Panamax/LR1 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet2

Aframax/LR2 Med volume showed as Recovered_sheet3

Panamax/LR1 Med showed as Recovered_sheet4

 

Trade Metrics Dirty

Aframax//LR2 MEG volume showed as Recovered_sheet1

Aframax/LR2 Nigeria/Angola volume showed as Recovered_sheet2

Aframax/LR2 Med volume showed as Recovered_sheet3

 

Also, for Trade Metrics Clean file, we lack the sheet of MR Middle East Gulf volume. The MR Middle East Gulf Shipment sheet showed that there should be a steady volume exporting from the region, please kindly check this before our next update.

2.	As exchanged earlier, we should have 0s returning in some certain sheets. We need to show weeks with a result of 0 here as well, rather than deleting them.  For example:



For sheets like this, we should have other weeks return 0. In this refresh, each table in the trade metrics files should return 396 results (396 weeks), and we need to show 0 here as well.

3.	For Trade Metrics_Dirty, please add Russia – Black Sea for the BlackSea results as well. Far East region in Trade Metrics_Clean is corrected is updated too. Please find the highlighted area in the attached file.

 

Many thanks for your support on this.

Could you kindly combine them from your side? As discussed:

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Please find attached our enquiry files shared. As discussed, we would like you to extract all vessel sectors for dirty/clean separately; that is, VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax/LR2 for dirty tankers; VLCC, Suezmax, LR2/Aframax, LR1/Panamax, MR for clean tankers (monitoring bigger tonnages such as VLCC and Suezmax would allow us to capture the cleanup trend therefore we put them on the list.). We expect to have lots of 0s returned from result, we believe it would ensure a minimal update in the future.

 

Also, as per today’s call, I have updated Ballast Analytics’ sheet hoping that you could manage to find a way to use start region/end region instead of start country/end country.

 

We can connect on details if needed tomorrow. Appreciate your support on this update, however if the changes of codes cannot be fulfilled before next Monday (as we see the weekly update as the priority), please kindly refresh our sheets as per we previous sent.

 

Many thanks.

Hi Sachin,

 

Please let us know when the next update could be in place, as discussed, we hope this could be a weekly regular one.

 

Meanwhile, we also noticed that in the file Trade_Metrics_Clean, we couldn’t find LR2’s shipments from India. I have highlighted it in yellow for next update, please kindly check the attachment.

 

Also, as discussed previously on the call, we are having 0s for some week’s results in some tabs, especially when extracting clean Panamax and dirty LR2s. These rows were not showing, causing us some verifying trouble. Considering this, could you converge these data together? In short, could you include clean-trading Panamaxes and clean LR1s together, labeled as clean LR1s? In the same manner, dirty-trading LR2s and dirty Aframaxes together, labeled as LR2s?

 

Look forward to having your feedback. We can have a call to discuss this when you are available.

Hi Kevin, 

 

I will connect with Penang team related to regular data extraction. I will send you update by tomorrow.

 

Furthermore, I have made the correction on Ballast Analytics file.

For trade matrics I will try to investigate why data is not populated for black sea.

 

Thanks,

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

As discussed earlier, please keep us posted if Penang team could provide us with the regular refreshments by every Monday, starting from next Monday.

 

Also as mentioned, I have corrected the metrics for Ballast Analytics file. Please include Russia as part of the Black Sea, I have highlighted the change in yellow for you reference too.

 

Please also include clean LR1/Panamax for UKC laden/ballast as well. They are highlighted as well.

 

For Trade_Metrics_Dirty file, Black Sea returns nothing however we have selected all countries under the region Black Sea:



Is this because you have to choose countries manually and Russia was not included? If that’s the case please include Russia there too, many thanks.

 

Let’s discuss tomorrow in detail on how to get the regular update if you are available, thank you once again on your help.

Hi Kevin, 

 

I have gone through the requirement documents provided by you in previous mail.

We will start working on this from next week. 

As the requirements are updated and some newly added. It may take more time to generate the data than previous iteration.

Hi Sachin,

 

I hope the email finds you well.

 

Following our previous exchanges please find our data extraction enquiry in CAS LB. We will need your help in pulling data from the Data Query this time. 

 

The data should be refreshed on a weekly basis, could you confirm if this is possible once the preparation is done ? We can arrange a call at your convenience to discuss the details.

 

Look forward to hearing from you soon.
